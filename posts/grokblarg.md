# Grokblarg
Grokblarg is my first attempt at a static-site-generator to use with GitHub pages. Initially I was adding this dev-log-content to an .md file that would live alongside the README or intro content, but realized this can simply be my first post ever! That's kinda meta right, the initial post of a blog being about writing the code to produce the blog...

## Ideas
I want to write posts as markdown.  
The markdown will be parsed into html.  
Live samples should be injectable with HTML/CSS/JavaScript demos.  
Styling applied.  
The built product will be a set of static asset pages, which I will push to GitHub repo.  

A Post should contain meta-data such as:
* title
* author
* keywords
* created date
* updated date

I would like to keep the styling and design minimal, very semantic-web to begin.    
I would like the layout to be mobile-friendly first.  
I would like to have a main-page like most blogs, offering latest updates in chronological (recent-to-ancient) order.  
I would like to have a menu page which provides an index of Posts, ways to search and filter, plus access to any other options my Blog will present.  
I intend to design my Posts so that they may be updated/appended later.
